## Sparse CNN
Using sparse convolutions as an alternative to traditional dense networks.
This sparse CNN uses a modified Siamese version of the FishNet to ingest two 2D images for NOvA detector images. 
NOvA is a 810 km long-baseline neutrino detector experiment spanning from the Near Detector at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory to the Far Detector at Ash River, MN.
